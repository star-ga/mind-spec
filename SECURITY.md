# Security Policy

We take the security of the MIND ecosystem seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability that affects the specification, documentation tooling, or published artifacts, please report it privately so we can investigate and patch the issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- Email: [security@cputer.com](mailto:security@cputer.com)
- Include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce the issue (steps, affected files, potential impact).
- If the report involves sensitive data, request an encrypted channel in your initial email.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **3 business days** and provide status updates at least every **7 days** until the issue is resolved.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- Content hosted in this repository and the resulting GitHub Pages site.
- Build or deployment workflows defined under `.github/workflows/`.
- Companion packages or assets that ship with the specification.

Issues unrelated to security (typos, feature requests, etc.) should be filed as regular GitHub issues instead of using the email channel.

## Preferred languages

We accept reports in **English**.
