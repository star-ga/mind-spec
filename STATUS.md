| Core language spec | `docs/spec/` | ✅ Stable | Content mirrors the latest compiler implementation. Minor clarifications welcome. |
| Standard library | `docs/spec/stdlib.md` | 📝 Draft available | Core API coverage added; align with `cputer/mind-runtime` before marking stable. |
| RFCs | `docs/rfcs/` | 📝 Drafts in progress | New proposals accepted via pull requests. Older RFCs may need modernization. |
| Design notes | `docs/design/` | 🚧 Under active development | Requires more diagrams and examples to aid new contributors. |
